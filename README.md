### Overview
* [Data cleaning code](https://github.com/yixinsun1216/pm_autocracy/tree/main/code/data_cleaning) cannot be run as is, since data is stored elsewhere. Data is available upon request.
* [Descriptive statistics code](https://github.com/yixinsun1216/pm_autocracy/blob/main/code/desc_stats.R), showcasing the raw relationship between WHO reported and satellite-derived PM2.5 data
* [Formal statistical analysis](https://github.com/yixinsun1216/pm_autocracy/blob/main/code/reg_pm_democracy.R) which mirrors the descriptive statistics, formally testing if more autocratic countries are systematically underreporting PM2.5 levels
* [Slide deck](https://github.com/yixinsun1216/pm_autocracy/blob/main/analyses_slides) presenting the key outputs from both descriptive statistics and formal statistical analysis. The main focus is on descriptive statistics for ease of exposition, while the statistical analysis in the appendix reinforces and confirms the trends observed in the descriptive statistics.

These analyses are a part of an ongoing research project, and are thus subject to ongoing edits.
